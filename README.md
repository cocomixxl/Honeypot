![Honeypot Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10ef677b-ce96-41d9-9c44-1c9112f382d9)
## Overview
I use TPOT HoneyPot because it automates machine learning for cybersecurity tasks like detecting attacks or analyzing honeypot data while still giving me the full power of TPOT’s automated pipeline search. It’s optimized for network traffic and threat detection, so I don’t have to build models from scratch. Other AutoML tools aren’t tailored for security like this one

## Features
- Real-time attack visualization using Kibana/Elasticvue
- Attack pattern analysis
- Integrated threat intelligence with Spiderfoot
- Custom security monitoring configurations
