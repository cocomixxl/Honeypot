## Overview
I use TPOT because it automates everything feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning while searching for the best pipeline. It even generates the code for me, saving time and effort. Other tools donâ€™t go as deep or give me a complete solution like TPOT does.

## Features
- Real-time attack visualization using Kibana/Elasticvue
- Attack pattern analysis
- Integrated threat intelligence with Spiderfoot
- Custom security monitoring configurations
